\title{Choose a threshold to classify observations that are consistent with theory m}
\usage{
lambda_max(probability, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{probability}{A vector of posterior probabilities.}

\item{alpha}{The value for which the odds-ratio of posterior probabilities must exceed. Defaults to discarding all posterior probabilities for which the odds-ratio exceeds 0.05; u}
}
\description{
To determine which observations are consistent with each theory or none, a threshold must be chosen above which an observation \eqn{i} is considered consistent with theory \eqn{m}. This function considers all theories and observations and returns the largest threhold.
}
\details{
The function calculates the maximum threshold \eqn{\lambda} for which (probability of not happening)/(probability of happening) < \eqn{\alpha} for values that exceed threshold \eqn{\lambda}. (Defaults to \eqn{\alpha} := 0.05)
